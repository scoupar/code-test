## Hudson Code Test

Test completed in Python, using the Beautiful Soup and requests libraries to scrape the webpage. 

Iterated through all items with the class 'product-tile' and for each item created a productObject containing all requested data. Each object is then appended to the productArr list.  

A JSON file is then generated with the productArr list.
